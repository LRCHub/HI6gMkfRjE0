[00:09.22] I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
[00:11.80] Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
[00:14.52] On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
[00:16.92] Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
[00:19.49] Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
[00:22.11] Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
[00:24.95] Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
[00:27.93] Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
[00:30.51] Livе my lifе as a boss player, 'cause evеn gettin' high
[00:33.09] These niggas got me tossin' shit
[00:34.87] I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
[00:37.43] Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
[00:40.12] The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
[00:42.81] Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
[00:45.31] One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
[00:47.86] Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
[00:49.92] They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
[00:52.39] We got foe niggas and low riders in ski masks
[00:55.56] Screamin', "Thug Life" every time they pass, all eyes on me

[01:32.23] The hooker layer, motherfucker, say your prayers!
[01:34.86] "Hail Mary, full of grace..." Smack the bitch in the face
[01:38.15] Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back

[01:51.64] The head honcho, swift fists like Cu-macho
[01:54.26] I got so much styles I should be down with the Stylistics
[01:57.05] "Make up to break up," niggas need to wake up

[02:12.84] And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
[02:15.68] I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
[02:18.67] I was Humpin' Around and Jumpin' Around
[02:20.97] Jacked her, then, I asked her, "Who's her man?" She said, "B-I-G,"
[02:23.86] Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)
